# resource-pack-mod
A basic resource pack mod for Mindustry. Purely an example.

Steps to make a resource pack:
1. Find the names of the sprites you desire to replace [Anuken/Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/tree/master/core/assets-raw/sprites)
2. Make the new sprites, and name them the same as the sprites hey are replacing
3. Make a new mod (with a valid mod.hjson)
4. Put the new sprites in the sprites-override folder
5. Use the mod (Remember: use the folder *inside* the zip. *That* is the actual mod folder.)
